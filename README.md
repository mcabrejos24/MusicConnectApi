# Playlist Pair

Playlist Pair is a project I wanted to do to solve the problem of people not being able to share playlists when they have different music services. Now, with this project, users are able to sync up their gym, work, etc. type of playlists with their friends that use another platform.

An alternative way of using the project is for when you are switching services yourself. If you decide to go from Spotify to Apple, or vice-versa, then you can use this project to move each of your playlists over with ease.

Playlist Pair is accessible at [playlistpair.com]

The backend of the project is accessible at [Playlist Pair API].

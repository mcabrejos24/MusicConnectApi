          This one is made for when both your peer has already done the second option.
          <br />
          <br />
          Simply, enter the Sync ID that was emailed or texted to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          You then choose the playlist you would like to sync.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you want to make a new playlist, then enter the name of the new playlist and press the button below it to create it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then, since you peer has already provided their information, you just need to press the Sync button and your playlists will be synced!
          <br />
          <br />
          Enjoy sharing your playlist!

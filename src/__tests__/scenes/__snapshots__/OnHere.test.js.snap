          This syncing method is for when both you and your peer are together in the same room.
          <br />
          <br />
          Or if you have access to both services yourself.
          <br />
          <br />
          Simply, one of you logs into your Apple Music account and the other into your Spotify.
          <br />
          <br />
          You both then choose the playlist you would like to sync.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you want to make a new playlist, then enter the name of the new playlist and press the button below it to create it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Note that for Apple Music, you will need to add a song after creating a new playlist on here, or on the service.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then just press the Sync button and your playlists will be synced!
          <br />
          <br />
          The progress bar helps tell you what step you are on.
